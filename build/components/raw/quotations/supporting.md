<p>Use quotations when you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>want to refer to what someone said, not to pull out text written within the page copy</li>
    <li>are referring to an external source - remember to cite the author and if possible link to their original work</li>
    <li>are knowingly using a jargon word after giving a plain English description, for example, 'the people you want to sort out your will (known as 'executors')'</li>
</ul>

<p>Our quotations use hanging punctuation when using this pattern. This means the opening quotation mark must sit in the margin so as not to disrupt the flow (left alignment) of the text. If the quote is within the text (on the same line) it would not hang.</p>

<p>When marking up quotes in HTML - use true quotation marks. True quotes are called smart quotes and the right one must be used according to whether you are opening (&lsquo;) or closing (&rsquo;) a quotation. <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/punctuation/">Find out about HTML character codes used for quotes</a>.</p>
